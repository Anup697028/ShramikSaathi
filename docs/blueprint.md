## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Terracotta (#E07A5F) evokes feelings of earth, labor, and reliability.
- Background color: Light beige (#F8F5F1), a desaturated tone of terracotta, to provide a neutral, bright background that allows content to stand out.
- Accent color: Teal (#3D405B) for interactive elements and key actions; teal is analogous to terracotta, and the selected tone contrasts for visibility and an active feel.
- Font pairing: 'Belleza' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Alegreya' (serif) for body text. Belleza will provide a unique artistic tone to larger text, while Alegreya's high readability will make long text feel elegant.
- Use simple, line-based icons to represent different labor skills.
- Clean, card-based layout for displaying worker profiles.
- Subtle transitions when scheduling or confirming workers.
